## Introduction

A social DApp that uses NFT as a carrier to carry members’ valuable data like code snippets for depositing and sharing. We embed an achievement system counting members’ contribution by their posts, which would be listed on a honor board. And the branch is a community building metavese based on achievement system, the contribution of metaverse building would also be counted to support DSDN DAO. So the DAO would be in the charge of members who participates deeply in our community, laying the foundation for subsequent community management, resource utilisation and further development.

2. Data in the chain is a gold mine, the more applications, the more data, the bigger the gold mine
3. In Web 3.0, your valuable actions will eventually be given back, and the carrier of value is your data, which also belongs to you.
